# TrueOrFalse

## Introduction
Welcome to 'True or False?' - a C# console application where users can answer true/false questions and see their score at the end. The program will present a set of predefined true/false questions to the user and prompt them to respond with either 'true' or 'false.' After all the questions have been answered, the program will calculate and display the user's score based on the correct responses.

## How to Run
Make sure you have a C# development environment set up on your computer.
Download the source code files from this repository.
Open the TrueOrFalse.csproj file in your C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).
Build and run the application from the IDE or using the command-line interface.

## Learning
I used this small game to better understand loops and arrays.
